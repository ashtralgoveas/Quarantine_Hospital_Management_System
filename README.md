# Quarantine Hospital Management System

A Brief Overview: 
Details of Quarantined Patients and Staff Details are stored in the database. All the staff can view the details of the patient, but only the staff with required site_id can make changes into database. The staff who have made changes into the database system can be viewed by the Admin. Admin can either add or remove the staff members.
